# Spatial Econometrics in R


Hello world!

This is my first project in spatial econometrics. I analysed Dutch neighbourhoods ('wijk') in R. 
In this project, I used CBS wijk- en buurtkart from 2017. (https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/dossier/nederland-regionaal/geografische-data/wijk-en-buurtkaart-2017)

## How to run the file

1. Download Project.R 
2. Open the file in Rstudio and run the script

Note: make sure you have the packages listed at the beginning of the script installed before you run it.


Thank you for checking out the project.
